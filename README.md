# Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.

 **y=mx+b** 
 where m is the slope and b is the intercept.

The motive of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best values for m and b. 

In this project, simple linear regression model is created by two  methods:

 > Using normal python code
 
 > Using library
 
 # raw_code.py
 This file contains the raw code for creating model for simple linear regression and its mean squared error is also found.
 
 # using_lib.py
 This file contains code which uses sklearn library. LinearRegression class is imported from the sub module of sklearn, linear_model.
  >sklearn is the library used for creating most of the machine learning models.

# plot_graph.py
This file will plot the line on the graph which is the best fit for the given dataset.
